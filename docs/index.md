    <p>Secure, scalable data integration system for genomic and clinical data management in research environments.</p>
    <p>GRIP (Graph Integration Platform) is an open-source, high-performance graph query engine and integration platform designed to provide a unified graph-based interface across a variety of existing database technologies. GRIP enables the construction and analysis of large-scale property graphs by abstracting the underlying storage—supporting backends ranging from MongoDB and SQL to high-speed key-value stores like Badger and Pebble. With a powerful query API inspired by Apache TinkerPop and native support for both gRPC and HTTP, GRIP allows researchers to seamlessly integrate, traverse, and analyze heterogeneous datasets, facilitating complex relational discovery and data exploration within a scalable, multi-backend environment.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Funnel</h2>
      <p>High-performance data pipeline for genomic data processing and analysis at petabyte scale.</p>
      <p>Funnel is an open-source, distributed task execution toolkit designed to simplify and standardize how batch computing jobs are run across diverse infrastructures. By implementing the GA4GH Task Execution Schema (TES) API, Funnel provides a unified interface that allows researchers and developers to seamlessly execute Docker-based tasks on anything from a local machine to large-scale cloud environments like AWS, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. The system automates the entire lifecycle of a task—including resource scheduling, data staging from various storage backends (such as S3 or Google Storage), and real-time log tracking—enabling a "write once, run anywhere" workflow for complex computational pipelines.</p>
