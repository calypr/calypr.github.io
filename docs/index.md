## About
The [calypr_admin](https://github.com/CALYPR/admin/) command line utility is a combination of tools that facilitate data sharing on the CALYPR platform. It allows you to create a unified data project, add users, and associate those files with metadata incrementally. Submitted projects give you all the benefits the data platform offers: data indexing, data exploration, consolidated access, and more!
