# 1\. Create/Initiate a Project (gen3 \+ GitHub)

Status: *Manual and DevOps‑only at the moment*

The standard way to start a new Calypr project is to create a Git repository that will hold your FHIR NDJSON files and a set of Git‑LFS tracked files.

For now you will need to ask a Calypr management team to create the project and provide you with the following:

* GitHub repository URL  
* Calypr project ID  
* Initial git config settings (branch, remotes, etc.)

Future Work: Automate this step with a CLI wizard.

TODO – Write the DevOps‑only project creation guide.
