# GraphQL

Grip graphql tools are defined as go standard library plugins and are located at https://github.com/bmeg/grip-graphql.
A schema based approach was used for defining read plugins.

## Json Schema

grip also supports using jsonschema with hypermedia extensions. Given an existing graph called TEST

```
./grip schema post TEST --jsonSchema schema.json
```

This schema will attach to the TEST graph, and subsequent calls to the bulkAddRaw method with raw Json
as defined by the attached the jsonschema will load directly into grip.

see conformance/tests/ot_bulk_raw.py for an example

## Future work

In the future, autogenerated json schema may be added back to grip to continue to support graphql queries. Currently there is not support for graphql in base Grip without using the plugin repos specified above.
